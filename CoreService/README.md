## Release notes

### v2.4.3

- Added support for Sites 9.0 (e.g. "Set-TridionCoreServiceSettings -Version Sites-9.0")

- Added support for Active Directory Federation Services.

Special thanks to Sayantan Basu and Mihai Cadariu for their contributions to this version.

### v2.4.1

- Fixed an issue that occurred during publishing of the module to PowerShell Gallery.

### v2.4.0

- Most cmdlets and their parameters have been reviewed and adjusted to fit the "[Strongly Encouraged Development Guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878270%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)" from Microsoft.
  Aliases have been provided, so your existing scripts will likely continue to work. 
  **Exception:** calling Get-TridionUser without parameters no longer returns the current user (see below).
- Added support for the PowerShell pipeline as input to most functions.
- Set-TridionCoreServiceSettings and Clear-TridionCoreServiceSettings now support -PassThru to return the updated settings.
- Get-TridionPublications have been renamed to Get-TridionPublication.
  - It now supports look-ups by ID and (partial) Title. This will return all Publications that match the given title.
  - The parameter 'Parents' has been renamed to 'Parent' and supports passing a single value or an array and the values may be strings (URIs) or objects (other Publications).
  - You may also set the parents using the pipeline (e.g. Get-TridionPublication -Title '500 Website *' | New-Publication -Title 'Inherits from all 500 Website Publications')
- Get-TridionUsers has been renamed to Get-TridionUser.
  - It now supports look-ups by ID, (partial) Title, (partial) Description, and a custom filtering script block. This will return all matching the criteria.
  - The -Filter parameter can now be piped into the method.
  - **(Breaking change)** When called without a parameter, it no longer returns the current user (but all users). To get the current user, specify the -Current switch.
- Get-TridionGroups has been renamed to Get-TridionGroup.
- Added support for basic HTTP connections to the Core Service (ConnectionType setting) and the ability to override the CredentialType (which also supports Basic now)
- Introduced Pester scripts to test the functionality and ensure backwards-compatibility. These are not installed but are run when code is checked into GitHub.
- Added a function to Unpublish items (Unpublish-TridionItem)
- Fixed an error during local installation that occurred if the My Documents folder does not exist.

Special thanks to Jacques Kors and @ronnqvistandreas for their contributions to this version.

### v2.3.0

- Added a function to Publish items (Publish-TridionItem)
- You may now run the module as a different user by specifying the Credential setting (e.g. "Set-TridionCoreServiceSettings -Credential (Get-Credential)")
  NOTE: The username and password are encrypted and are safe to store using the -Persist parameter.
- Added a function to reset your settings to the default values (Clear-TridionCoreServiceSettings)
- Added support for viewing the Publish Queue and removing Publish transactions (Get-TridionPublishTransaction, Remove-TridionPublishTransaction)
- Added support for creating and deleting Tridion items of any type (New-TridionItem, Remove-TridionItem)
- Added support for Web 8.5 (e.g. "Set-TridionCoreServiceSettings -Version Web-8.5")

  Both methods support loading the items either by TCM URI or the Title of the item.
- Added support for reading a user by Title or Description.
- Added Test-TridionItem, which returns a boolean indicating if the item exists in the Content Manager.

### v2.1.0

- Added support for managing application data (Get-TridionApplicationData, Set-TridionApplicationData, Remove-TridionApplicationData).
