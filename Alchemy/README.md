# Tridion-Alchemy module

This module contains cmdlets that allow you to manage [Alchemy](http://www.alchemywebstore.com) plugins for your Tridion Content Manager.
Install, uninstall, or update plugins directly from PowerShell. Or let the Plugin Monitor cmdlet do it for you whenever your plugin changes.
